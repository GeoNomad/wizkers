Wizkers
============

Wizkers extends the reach of your measurement instruments.

Wizkers is both an application and a framework, written entirely in Javascript and HTML5, which runs either as a Chrome Packaged App, a Cordova 'native' Android application, or even as a server app. All using one single codebase!

You can use Wizkers with supported devices, and visualize their data, save it into logs, and forward it to backend web  services. Depending on the device, Wizkers can also go pretty far when it comes to editing the settings, downloading on-device logs, etc.

You will find all the information you need on www.wizkers.io.
