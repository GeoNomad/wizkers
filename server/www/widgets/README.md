The widgets directory contains static HTML pages that can be used to display logs in standalone mode.

The idea here is to copy templates, change a few variables in the HTML code, and then embed them on any external page where the data should be displayed.

Each instrument plugin can define as many widgets as it wants.

TODO: create a web-based interface to allow users to download widget code along with support libs.
